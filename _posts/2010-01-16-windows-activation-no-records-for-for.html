I recently installed Windows 7 Enterprise Edition on one of my PC. Eager to get my PC up and running with all software I daily use, I skipped activation.

When I tried to activate a few days later, I was greeted by this error message:
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_oymlMPJmD08/S1FwVkphmNI/AAAAAAAAABg/xfgkMQzPAGo/s1600-h/Activation.PNG"><img style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; DISPLAY: block; HEIGHT: 211px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427242541875566802" border="0" alt="No records found for given DNS query" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_oymlMPJmD08/S1FwVkphmNI/AAAAAAAAABg/xfgkMQzPAGo/s320/Activation.PNG" /></a>Searching for this message, you might end up on this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/938450">Microsoft support page</a> telling you to check you DNS settings. In my case this didn't apply at all.
<p>In the end it turns out that I ot this message because I hadn't entered my product key yet because I skipped activation during setup. To solve the issue, I:</p><ul><li>went to "Control Panel\System and Security\System" </li><li>clicked "change product key"</li><li>entered a valid product key</li></ul><p>Windows automatically activated.
